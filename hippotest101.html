    <h3>How to get inspiration for making apps</h3>
    <p>To get inspiration, simply look at your phone. Which ones of these apps do you think
        people who use HTMLOS would benefit from? There's your new coding project. Have fun!
    </p>
    <h3>What are the conditions for apps on HTMLOS?</h3>
   <p> No apps should have any inapropriate content, nudity, ect. No apps should contain private
    information of your own, real name, home address, email, so on and so forth. No apps should
    be political whatsoever, as these are very controvercial topics.</p>
    <h3>How to have my app published?</h3>
    <p>To have your app published, simply message the files to me on Discord "@deacon0089"</p>
<h3>Why is it called HippoTest?</h3>
<p>It's called HippoTest so people who aren't part of the Winx Coding group won't click on this app,
    which would allow them to access info they shouldn't be able to.
