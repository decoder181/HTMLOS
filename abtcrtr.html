<center><h1>What about the creator?</h1>
<p> Hello, it's me, the creator of the very project you're checking out right now. In this short page, I will explain why I made this, who I am, and how I made it.</p>
<h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
<p>I made this as my basic passion project, since I always thought that coding was interesting. Thanks to the simplicity of HTML, I could easily make everything you see here.</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am a 12 year old, hoping to eventually be good at coding. I am from America, am a male, and am making all of this on a basic Chromebook XD.</p>
<h2>How did I make this?</h2>
<p>I made this through multiple tutorials, anger, and boredom. Since most HTML code is easy to remember, I can fill out these pages as much as I want, but I don't since I'm lazy.</p>
